# Mint-Y-icon-expansion-pack

This is an icon pack that updates and adds new icons that blend well with Linux Mint's Mint-Y icons pack on top of that icon pack, also it adds extra symlinks for existing icons!

Please note that this icon is meant to be used alongside the original Mint-Y icons pack since this pack only has the updated icons.

Also note that I did not design these icons, I compiled many .svg files from many sources to one .png icon pack I will try to give credit below to all the desginers of these icons (If you made an icon and did not put you here please tell me).
## How to install the icons?

- Make sure that you have Mint-Y icon pack INSTALLED on your system in /usr/share/icons

- Download the latest file from releases

- Extract the file you have dowloaded and copy it to /home/<username>/icons

- Apply Mint-Y theme & enjoy
